# Work-Day-Scheduler
Description:
This is a basic workday scheduler. I used the time card htmls that was given to me at the beginning and gave them individual ids that go with the hour. In the script file I made a function for the time because for some reason I could not get it to work based off of activities in class but this does work. then a function that tracks the hour by getting the id of the hour from the each card. then an if statement that compares the time of the hour on the card and the current card to add the past, present, and future class therefore changing the colors. Then a function for the save button to save the time the text was written and the text that was written. this saves to local storage which is then loaded at the end.
